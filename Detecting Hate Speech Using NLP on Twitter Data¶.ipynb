    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s digital world, social media platforms have become essential arenas for public dialogue, particularly around politics. In Kenya, platforms like Twitter are not only used to share opinions and rally support but are also battlegrounds for targeted hate speech—especially toward political figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to detect hate speech in tweets directed at Kenyan politicians. By analyzing real tweets mentioning individuals such as the President,Deputy President, governors and many others, we seek to understand the patterns of online hate and create a model that classifies content as hate speech or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage standard NLP techniques—such as preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF or embeddings), and modeling using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or transformer models like BERT. The project also incorporates exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in hateful language, common keywords, and sentiment shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Imagine a Twitter-like platform where users can post freely. With this model in place, hate speech posts can be automatically flagged or hidden within seconds—drastically improving the experience for users and reducing platform liability.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this work supports efforts in online safety, content moderation, and digital peacebuilding. The resulting model can assist social media teams, NGOs, and civic tech groups in identifying harmful political discourse in real time."

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Kenyan politicians often face verbal attacks online, particularly during elections, political controversies, or ethnic debates. This hate speech can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incite real-world violence\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deepen ethnic divisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Harm reputations and mental well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "- Undermine democratic participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual moderation is slow and subjective, and harmful posts can go viral before they are taken down. An automated detection system is therefore critical for early intervention and risk mitigation."

    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "To evaluate our machine learning model’s effectiveness, we will track:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy – How often the model predicts correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision (Hate class) – % of flagged hate tweets that were actually hateful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall (Hate class) – % of true hate tweets the model managed to detect\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1 Score – A balance between precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix – A detailed view of false positives and false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Impact Metrics\n",
    "In addition to technical accuracy, we will evaluate the solution based on its real-world impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moderation efficiency – Reduction in time required for human review\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection speed – Time taken to flag hate speech from the moment it's posted\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coverage fairness – Model performance across tweets targeting different politicians\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explainability – Ability to justify flagged posts using explainable AI tools like SHAP or LIME\n",
